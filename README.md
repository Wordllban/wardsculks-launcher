## Description

**WardSculks** is a Ukrainian Minecraft project, known for its modded servers. This application enhances the user experience for players on our servers. It is designed to support multiple server systems and integrates a sophisticated anti-cheat system. This ensures that users cannot modify the modpacks, maintaining the integrity and fairness of the gameplay.

### Key Features:

- **Multi-Server Support:** Seamlessly switch between different servers for varied experiences.
- **Built-In Anti-Cheat System:** Prevents unauthorized modpack modifications, ensuring fair play.
- **Multiple Language Support**
- **Cross-platform**
- **Overriding of Minecraft launch arguments through App interface**
- **Discord Rich Presence**
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Powered by React and Tailwind CSS for a smooth, user-friendly experience.
- **Efficient Server Communication:** Leverages Electron for robust and efficient server interactions.
- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for predictable state management across the application.

### There are still much things to do

## Commands

Before starting the project in development, you will need to run post-install command to properly install and use native dependencies

```bash
yarn && yarn post-install
```

Start

```bash
yarn start

Before commit or build make sure to run linter

```bash
yarn lint

Create installation file, also do not forget to update version in `package.json`
